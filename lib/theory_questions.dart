      "question":
      "What is Computer programming?",
      "answer": "Computer Programming is also known as programming or coding. Programming is a process which includes processes such as coding, maintaining, updating, debugging, writing, designing (algorithm), etc.",
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question":
      "Describe how does programming work?",
      "answer": "Programming contains a set of instructions for the computer to perform different tasks. In fact, those instructions are executable commands, each having a different purpose.",
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question":
      "What is debugging?",
      "answer": "Debugging is the process of finding and removing errors in a program. In this process, the program is thoroughly checked for errors. Then errors are pointed out and debugged.",
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question":
      "Name different types of errors which can occur during the execution of a program? ",
      "answer": '''There are three types of errors which can occur during the execution of a program: 
      Syntax Errors
      Runtime Errors
      Logical errors''',
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question":
      "When a syntax error occurs?",
      "answer": "A syntax error occurs when the program violates one or more grammatical rules of the programming language. These errors are detected at compile time, i.e., when the translator (compiler or interpreter) attempts to translate the program.",
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question":
      " When a runtime error occurs?",
      "answer": "A runtime error occurs when the computer is directed to perform an illegal operation by the program such as dividing a number by zero. Runtime errors are the only errors which are displayed immediately during the execution of a program. When these errors occur, the computer stops the execution of the programming and can display a diagnostic message that will help in locating the error.",
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question":
      "When a logical error occurs?",
      "answer": "The logical error happens when a program implements the wrong logic. The translator (compiler or interpreter) does not report any error message for a logical error. These errors are the most difficult to locate.",
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question":
      "What is a flowchart?",
      "answer": "The flowchart is a pictorial representation of a program which helps in understanding the flow of control and data in the algorithm.",
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question":
      "What is an algorithm?",
      "answer": "An algorithm is a finite set of steps which, if followed, accomplish a particular task. An algorithm must be clear, finite and effective.",
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question":
      'What do you understand by the term “Maintain and update the Program”?',
      "answer": "Program maintenance is an ongoing process of upgrading the program to accommodate new hardware or software requirements and introducing minor or great improvements. Essentially, it is the expansion, updating and improvement of a program after its installation.",
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question":
      "What are variables?",
      "answer": "Variables are named memory locations (memory cells) which are used to store the program’s input and its computational results during program execution. As the name suggests, the value of a variable may change during the program execution.",
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question":
      "What are reserved words?",
      "answer": '''Reserved words or keywords are the words, which have predefined meanings. They have predefined uses and cannot be used or redefined for any other purpose in a programming language.

      "question":
      "What are loops?",
      "answer": "The loop is a structure which can repeat a set of statements up to a fixed number of times or until a certain criterion is satisfied.",
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question":
      "Name different types of loops.",
      "answer": ''' Different types of loops are:
      FOR…NEXT Loop
      WHILE…WEND Loop
      Nested Loop
      ''',
    },
